# shumway

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/shumway.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/shumway) [![Test Coverage](https://codecov.io/github/spotify/shumway/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/spotify/shumway)

A micro library for sending metrics to a [FFWD](https://github.com/spotify/ffwd) agent.

## Requirements

* Either Python 2.7 or 3.6. Tests pass on Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, and PyPy 5.8 (2.7.13).
* Support for Linux & OS X

## To Use

```sh
(env) $ pip install shumway
```

### Counters

Create a default counter and send to FFWD:

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME)
mr.incr(METRIC_NAME)
mr.flush()
```

#### Initialize a counter with a value

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME)
counter = shumway.Counter(metric_name, SERVICE_NAME, value=10)
mr.set_counter(metric_name, counter)
mr.incr(metric_name)
mr.flush()
```

#### Different increment values

Create a named counter and increment by a value different than 1:

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME)
mr.incr(METRIC_NAME, 2)
mr.flush()
```

#### Custom Counter Attributes

Set custom attributes for metrics. Default attributes/reousrces will be added to the Counter object if there are default attributes for the MetricRelay.

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME)
counter = shumway.Counter(metric_name, SERVICE_NAME,
                          {attr_1: value_1,
                           attr_2: value_2})

mr.set_counter(metric_name, counter)
mr.incr(metric_name)
mr.flush()

```

**NB:** If you use duplicate names when calling `set_counter` it will overwrite the
counter. You will likely want to use a unique metric name for each set of
attributes you are setting.


### Timers

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME)
timer = mr.timer('timing-this-thing')

with timer:
    ...task you want to time

mr.flush()
```

### Custom Timer Attributes
Timers can also be created independently in order to set custom attributes. Default attributes/resources will be added to the Timer object if there are default attributes for the MetricRelay.

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME)
timer = shumway.Timer('timing-this-thing', SERVICE_NAME,
                      {'attr_1': value_1, 'attr_2': value_2})

with timer:
    # ...task you want to time

mr.set_timer('timing-this-thing', timer)
mr.flush()
```

### Interacting with metrics objects
Metric objects (like a timer) themselves have a `flush` function as well as a `as_dict` function

```python
import shumway

timer = shumway.Timer('timing-this-thing', SERVICE_NAME,
                      {'attr_1': value_1, 'attr_2': value_2})
timer_as_dict = timer.as_dict()
timer.flush(lambda dict: do_smth())
```

### Default attributes for metrics
MetricRelay can create metrics with a common set of attributes as well. These will be added to any metrics created via the MetricRelay and to any object `set_*` on the Metrics.

```python
import shumway

attributes = dict(foo='bar')
mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME, default_attributes=attributes)
```

### Resource Identifiers
MetricsRelay and send resource identifiers as well:

```python
import shumway

resources = dict(podname='my_ephemeral_podname')
mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME, default_resources=resources)
```
For more on resource identifiers see [Heroic Documentation](https://spotify.github.io/heroic/docs/data_model)
### Sending Metrics

There are two ways to send metrics to the `ffwd` agent:

#### Emit one metric

You can emit a one-off, event-type metric immediately:

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay('my-service')

# some event happened
mr.emit('a-successful-event', 1)

# some event happened with attributes
mr.emit('a-successful-event', 1, {'attr_1': value_1, 'attr_2': value_2})

# an event with a multiple value happened
mr.emit('a-successful-event', 5)
```

#### Flushing all metrics

For batch-like metrics, you can flush metrics once you're ready:

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay('my-service')

# measure all the things
# time all the things

if not dry_run:
    mr.flush()
```

### Existing Metrics
Check for existence of metrics in the MetricRelay with `in`:

```pycon
>>> import shumway
>>> mr = shumway.MetricRelay('my-service')
>>> counter = shumway.Counter('thing-to-count', 'my-service', value=5)
>>> mr.set_counter('thing-to-count', counter)
>>> 'thing-to-count' in mr
True
>>> 'not-a-counter' in mr
False
```

### Custom FFWD agents

By default, `shumway` will send metrics to a local [`ffwd`](https://github.com/spotify/ffwd) agent at `127.0.0.1:19000`.

If your `ffwd` agent is elsewhere, then pass that information through when initializing the `MetricRelay`:

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME, ffwd_ip='10.99.0.1', ffwd_port=19001)

# do the thing
```

### Sending Metrics via HTTP to FFWD
Instead of via UDP it is also possible to send metrics via HTTP by setting the `use_http` flag:

```python
import shumway

mr = shumway.MetricRelay(SERVICE_NAME,
                         ffwd_host="http://my-metrics-api.com",
                         ffwd_port=8080,
                         ffwd_path="/v1/metrics",
                         use_http=True)
```

The `ffwd_host` parameter should be the HTTP endpoint and optionally `ffwd_path` can be set to specify the path.


# Changes

## Unreleased

## 2.0.1

* Default attributes and resources created on the MetricRelay will be inheritted by custom timers/counters now as well as one-off metrics via `.emit()`

## 2.0.0

* Positional arguments for `Meter()`, `Counter()`, `Timer()`, and `MetricRelay(...).emit()` were changed to add `resources`. If using only named arguments this should not be a problem.

# Developer Setup

For development and running tests, your system must have all supported versions of Python installed. We suggest using [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv).

## Setup

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:spotify/shumway.git && cd shumway
# make a virtualenv
(env) $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

## Running tests

To run the entire test suite:

```sh
# outside of the virtualenv
# if tox is not yet installed
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```

If you want to run the test suite for a specific version of Python:

```sh
# outside of the virtualenv
$ tox -e py27
$ tox -e py36
```

To run an individual test, call `nosetests` directly:

```sh
# inside virtualenv
(env) $ nosetests test/metrics_test.py
```
